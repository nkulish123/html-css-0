    <h1>Buffalo Wing Recipe</h1>
        <p>The beauty of baked buffalo chicken wings is that you can get the same, crispy texture without the need for splattering hot fryer oil. Using our handy baking powder trick and a wire rack, they get a wonderful crust with a fraction of the fat of deep-fried versions. Tossing the crispy wings together with a buttery, tangy buffalo sauce is irresistibly good.</p>
        <p>I've made this recipe many times and it's never disappointing. The crispy wing combined with the flavorful sauce makes for the perfect buffalo wing.</p>
