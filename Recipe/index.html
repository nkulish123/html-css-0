        <p>The beauty of baked buffalo chicken wings is that you can get the same, crispy texture without the need for
            splattering hot fryer oil.<br /> Using our handy baking powder trick and a wire rack, they get a wonderful
            crust with a fraction of the fat of deep-fried versions.<br /> Tossing the crispy wings together with a
            buttery, tangy buffalo sauce is irresistibly good.</p>
        <p>I've made this recipe many times and it's never disappointing. The crispy wing combined with the flavorful
            sauce makes for the perfect buffalo wing.</p>

            <li> Season the wings-Place the chicken wings in a large mixing bowl and toss them in the dry seasoning
                until well-coated. Assemble the wings in a single layer over the rack.</li>
            <li>Bake in the center of the oven for 50 minutes, flipping halfway.</li>
            <li>Make the Buffalo Sauce-In a medium bowl, stir together melted butter, sugar, and hot sauce.</li>
            <li>Toss Wings in Sauce-Transfer chicken wings to a bowl, and toss, drizzle with sauce and toss to coat.
                Serve with your favorite sauce.</li>
